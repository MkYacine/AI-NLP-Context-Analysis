# NLP-Context-Analysis
Machine learning algorithm for finding the context of the word "interest" in different sentences using Natural Language Processing with Scikit-learn. 
This work was done as a course-project for an introduction to artificial intelligence course at University of Montreal under prof Jian-Yun Nie.
TP.py contains the algorithm.
Rapport contains the report and instructions for using the algorithm.
interest and stoplist are files used by the algorithm.
